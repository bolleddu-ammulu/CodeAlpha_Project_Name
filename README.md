# Task-1:Titanic Classification:
In this project, I developed a predictive model using logistic regression to analyze survival outcomes from the Titanic disaster. The model leverages the Titanic survival dataset, which includes various socio-economic factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and other relevant variables.Logistic regression is well-suited for this analysis as it predicts the probability of a binary outcome—surviving or sinking—based on the input features.Through this project, I strengthened my skills in data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, which are crucial for effective decision-making in critical situations.

# Task-2: Stock Prediction:
In this project, I developed a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast the stock prices of Nvidia. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly effective in capturing temporal dependencies and patterns in sequential data, making it ideal for stock price prediction. By utilizing historical stock price data, including features such as closing prices, volume, and other financial indicators, the model learns to predict future prices. The Nvidia stock data was preprocessed and normalized before being fed into the LSTM network, which was trained and validated using a time-series approach. The model's performance was evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict short-term price movements.

8.Model Optimization
9.Deployment

# Task-3:Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression:
n this project, I developed a predictive model using linear regression to predict a numerical outcome based on one or more features from a dataset with a continuous target variable. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning technique that models the relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The project involved selecting a dataset with relevant features and a continuous target variable, preprocessing the data to handle missing values and scale features, and then training the linear regression model. The model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess its accuracy and goodness of fit. This project provided insights into the relationship between the features and the target variable, demonstrating the practical applications of linear regression in various domains, such as finance, economics, and engineering. Through this work, I gained experience in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, which are essential skills for effective predictive modeling.
